## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- you need to have [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed on your machine (Starting from jdk 8 or later)
- You need to have an IDE installed on your machine too, I recommend [IntellJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- And optionally you can have [Maven CLI](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.1/maven-embedder/cli.html) installed on your machine as it help when building or doing some other maven actions in spring boot applications
- For you to be able to test the endpoints you need to have an API testing tool like [Postman Client](https://www.postman.com/downloads) on your machine or alternatively I have configured Springdoc Swagger in this application which allow you to test the application easily without having to download another API testing tool
- So to test the endpoints with Swagger use this link http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html as the default server port for this applicaion is ``8080`` so once you decide to change the server port number remember to change it in the above swagger link too
